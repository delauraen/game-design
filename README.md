## Labor and Delivery
======
### Game Vision

#### Elevator Pitch
> Deliver babies in this futuristic cyberpunk world where you work for CybEx, the king of delivery and baby growing tech. You play as a budding driver struggling to meet your quota while also steering clear of any competing delivery drivers trying to steal your haul!

#### Plot
> Set in the future where babies are no longer carried to term by a person, instead are grown by massive corporations who are then responsible for delivering straight to your doorstep. The player is a driver for CybEx (The largest, most respected of delivery companies) who is banking their entire success on each shift. Deliver babies to the right home, avoid obstacles and competitors looking to steal your bag and meeting your daily quota.

> You start out with a bag of babies with tags that match their destination, you’ll need to sort through your bag while dodging enemies trying to intercept your package while aiming to deliver each baby to their forever home!

##### Inspirations
> Peggle meets Paperboy

#### Pillars
======
> **Endearing 2D/3D Hybrid Artstyle** 3D environment with lighting meets 2D pixel art and sprite animations

> **Hilarious Interactions** Enjoy comedic dialogue based on ‘fail’ and ‘success’ conditions for deliveries, as well as silly physics that tie it all together

> **Scaling Difficulty** As you progress the faster your driver moves, making it both harder to make successful deliveries and avoid obstacles


### Monetization
======
> *Free to play* Mobile game, *One time low cost* PC with *seasonal low cost battlepass* that offers cosmetic skins for player car, speed trails, baby delivery visual effects

======

## Mechanics
======

### Player Controls
> Player can move forward, left, right and adjust speed but annot move backwards. Over time speed increases by 20%
> Players cycle through different baby color tags before launching
> Player launches baby at the house with spacebar

### Rules
> Level one requires 10 successful deliveries (successful delivery = correct baby delivered to correct house) and slowly increases in requirements
> The player starts with 20 babies in their bag, colors will be randomly generated based on each time the playuer cycles
> If a player hits an obstacle they will slow down temporarily and it will be harder to move left and right, and they will be unable to deliver a baby within 5 seconds
